# Tips_for_Buy_Tolkien
Brief advice on choosing the ideal Tolkien book

## Why create this repo
In the past few years, I have bought many tolkien books, ranging from the 1990s to the present. Those books vary in paper material, binding, size, layout, pagination, and whether they have illustrations. Many readers are interested in entering Tolkien's world but are limited by their budgets. Since I have hundreds of books in my collection, and almost all of them are commercially available, I feel it is necessary to write a detailed report to guide interested readers in choosing their favorite Tolkien books.
